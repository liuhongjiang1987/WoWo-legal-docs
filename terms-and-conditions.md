## 1. Description of Service

WoWo is an AI-powered browser extension that helps you organize bookmarks. We may evolve the Service, including its features, business model, and data practices, from time to time. Material changes will be disclosed in our Privacy Policy and/or these Terms. The Extension:

- Analyzes the current webpage and your bookmark folder structure
- Uses artificial intelligence to recommend the most suitable folder for saving the page
- Allows you to confirm, modify, or discard recommendations
- Adds bookmarks to your browser's bookmark bar at the location you choose

The AI recommendations are provided for convenience only and do not constitute professional advice. You remain solely responsible for your bookmark organization and any actions you take based on the recommendations.
